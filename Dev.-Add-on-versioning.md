Kodi generally establishes the following version scheme: `x.y.z` (major.minor.patch)
[Kodi Wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/Addon.xml)

In detail this addon will follow the following methodology:

`X` for major interface changes or breaking changes (i.e. API, routing, backward-compatibility)<br/>
`Y` for minor interface changes or new features<br/>
`Z` for minor improvements or bug-fixes<br/>

Note: this versioning has been adopted since version 1.0.0
