# Netflix plugin for Kodi

## The project

This plugin was born in 2017 designed and created by [asciidisco](https://github.com/asciidisco/) with the initial purpose of studying the functioning of the DRMs.
The enthusiasm for its success has involved many other developers, who working together have been able to evolve this project into an unofficial platform, giving the opportunity to the Kodi community to use the Netflix service, in full compliance with current regulations.

## Notice for the use

This plugin is a result of various studies conducted over time by many developers, therefore as an unofficial plugin and not commissioned/supported by Netflix, there is no guarantee that there will be constant proper functioning, everything could break and not work at any time, depending on the changes imposed by Netflix.
