Due to some changes in the website (we think about new anti-bot protections)
login with E-Mail/Password could cause "Incorrect password" error, even when the credentials are correct.

The login with Authentication key is a method that allow you to login in to your account by using:<br/>
NFAuthentication.key file + PIN + Account password<br/>
and so "bypass" these restrictions.

## How to get the file NFAuthentication.key and the PIN

To create this file and get the PIN, you need to use one of the following software.

The file created cointains part of your account data that will be encrypted, and can be used to login on all type of devices/systems where the Netflix add-on is installed.

The file will become no more valid after 5 days, remember to delete it after his use.
