When you need to share the same Kodi exported library (of Netflix videos) with multiple devices, there are two possibilities of setting.

_But first a foreword:_<br/>
This add-on makes use of an internal database to manage the videos exported to the Kodi library,
so pay attention to cases of use, to avoid compromising the internal database, where in the best cases the menus to manage the exported videos (e.g. add, remove) will be inconsistents, in the worst cases increasing the risk of ban cases of Netflix account due to a too heavy synchronization.

So be careful to choose the case that suits your needs.

### CASE 1 - All devices can manage the Kodi library of netflix exported items

Recommended method




### CASE 2 - Only a main device must manage the Kodi library of netflix exported items, any other device must access to the library in read-only mode

Not recommended, can causing problems explained above
