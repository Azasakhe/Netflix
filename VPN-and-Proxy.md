Netflix does not recommend the use of these network accesses, in some cases warns the user who tries to access the content with a warning.
This is because it may unlock content that is not allowed in some countries (geo-blocking).

The rules on their legality, changes from country to country.
Some countries sanction the users who use VPN/Proxy to circumvent the restrictions, with heavy penalties.

In compliance with the rules of the Kodi platform and members of its foundation and to avoid legal problems, _this add-on does not support the use of VPN or Proxy_.

**Therefore, the maintainers of this add-on are completely estranged from those who do not respect these rules, each user who will use it, will do so at their own use and danger.**
